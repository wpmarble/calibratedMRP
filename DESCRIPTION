Description: Provides tools for small area estimation using multilevel 
    regression and poststratification (MRP). Provides a user-friendly interface
    implementing an intercept correction to ensure model-based estimates match 
    known population margins. Estimates of other quantities are updated in light
    of the calibration using methods in Marble and Clinton (2024).
